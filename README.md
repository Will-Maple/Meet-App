From this app you can see events in global cities and access details and data about the events. 
The goal is to grab events from public calendars to be made accessible offline in an app that has over 90% test coverage (it actually has %100).

It was built using a Test Driven Development approach from...

{
    React,js,
    Jest,
    Cucumber,
    Puppeteer,
    Amazon Lambda,
    Serverless,
    Progressive Web Application (PWA),
    Google Calendar API
 } 

The app stores sample movie from the youtube channel "MosFilm" in a MongoDB Database and allows users to enter, update, or delete their data. The user, once authenticated, is allowed to get the movie data and add or remove movies to a list of their favorites.

The project is available on Github (https://github.com/Will-Maple/movie_api) and may be deployed here (https://mosfilm-api.onrender.com/). The deployment link contains further documentation.
